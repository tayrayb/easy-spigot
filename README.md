Spigot is a custom high performance Minecraft server. It is compatible with all Bukkit plugins, and Spigot even builds the original Craftbukkit server.

Execute start.sh in your terminal to get started and follow instructions.
If the script wont execute under OSX or Linux, run the command below:

```javascript
chmod +x ./start.sh
```

On Windows, simply run the `start.bat` file!

The Spigot server is stored in the `Spigot` folder, where you can edit your settings to your hearts delight! Throw bukkit/spigot plugins into the `plugins` folder to add even more functionality to your server.

I wrote this script to simplify the workflow of managing and building Spigot and Craftbukkit from source. I would just like to share it to make everyone else's lives easier. Cheers!

Happy minecrafting!
